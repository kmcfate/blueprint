blueprintignore(5) -- ignore specific files when creating blueprints
====================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

	/etc/foo
	!foo/bar
	baz*

## DESCRIPTION

Lines in `~/.blueprintignore` are interpreted as in `gitignore`(5).  Blank lines and lines that begin with a `#` will be ignored.  Patterns that begin with a `!` are negated.  As files are considered for inclusion in a blueprint, the last matching line in `~/.blueprintignore` wins.

Patterns that do not contain a `/` are matched using `fnmatch`(3) against the last component of each file considered.  Patterns that contain a `/` but do not begin with a `/` are expanded relative to `/etc` before being matched using `glob`(3).

As part of `blueprint-create`(1), the `~/.blueprintignore` file that was used to create the blueprint is stored as `.gitignore` in the local blueprint repository.

The following files and directories are part of the default ignore list.  They can be negated using `!` just like any other pattern.

* `*.dpkg-*`
* `/etc/.git`
* `/etc/.pwd.lock`
* `/etc/alternatives`
* `/etc/apparmor`
* `/etc/apparmor.d`
* `/etc/ca-certificates.conf`
* `/etc/dpkg/origins/default`
* `/etc/fstab`
* `/etc/group-`
* `/etc/group`
* `/etc/gshadow-`
* `/etc/gshadow`

* `/etc/ld.so.cache`
* `/etc/localtime`
* `/etc/mailcap`
* `/etc/mtab`
* `/etc/modules`
* `/etc/motd`
* `/etc/network/interfaces`
* `/etc/passwd-`
* `/etc/passwd`
* `/etc/popularity-contest.conf`
* `/etc/prelink.cache`
* `/etc/resolv.conf`
* `/etc/rc0.d`
* `/etc/rc1.d`
* `/etc/rc2.d`
* `/etc/rc3.d`
* `/etc/rc4.d`
* `/etc/rc5.d`
* `/etc/rc6.d`
* `/etc/rcS.d`

* `/etc/shadow`
* `/etc/ssl/certs`
* `/etc/sysconfig/network`
* `/etc/timezone`
* `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-*.rules`

The following files are ignored if their content matches an expected hash.  They can be negated using `!` just like any other pattern.  These comparisions are made to augment searching files from packages to handle files that are part of packages but are not explicitly listed.

* `/etc/adduser.conf`
* `/etc/apparmor.d/tunables/home.d/ubuntu`
* `/etc/chatscripts/provider`
* `/etc/default/console-setup`
* `/etc/default/grub`
* `/etc/default/irqbalance`
* `/etc/default/locale`
* `/etc/default/rcS`
* `/etc/environment`
* `/etc/hosts.allow`
* `/etc/hosts.deny`
* `/etc/initramfs-tools/modules`
* `/etc/inputrc`
* `/etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf`
* `/etc/kernel-img.conf`
* `/etc/ld.so.conf`
* `/etc/networks`
* `/etc/nsswitch.conf`
* `/etc/ppp/chap-secrets`
* `/etc/ppp/pap-secrets`
* `/etc/ppp/peers/provider`
* `/etc/profile`
* `/etc/python/debian_config`
* `/etc/rc.local`
* `/etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf`
* `/etc/security/opasswd`
* `/etc/sgml/xml-core.cat`
* `/etc/shells`
* `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
* `/etc/sudoers`
* `/etc/ufw/after.rules`
* `/etc/ufw/after6.rules`
* `/etc/ufw/before.rules`
* `/etc/ufw/before6.rules`
* `/etc/ufw/ufw.conf`

These defaults are not meant to be an exhuastive list of exceptions and edge cases found on Debian/Ubuntu systems.  Rather, they're meant to cover the base installation without hassle.

## FILES

* `~/.blueprints.git`:
  The local repsitory where blueprints are stored, each on its own branch.
